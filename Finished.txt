Objective
Add NPCs that interact with the player in town.

Goals
1. Create an `NPC` class with dialogue and location.
2. Display NPCs on the map with images/fallbacks.
3. Trigger dialogue when colliding with NPCs.
4. Implement wrapped text dialogue boxes.

Accomplishments
- NPCs appear in town with images or fallback rectangles (rectangles since it was rushed).
- Dialogue displays in a readable, wrapped text box.
- Integrated seamlessly with existing map and player movement.

# Self-Evaluation
- **What went well: NPCs integrated smoothly, dialogue wrapping worked, and exception handling prevented crashes.
- **Challenges: Positioning dialogue text and ensuring readability. (text wasnt fully showing dialogue) 
- **How I overcame them* Implemented text wrapping and semi-transparent dialogue boxes.

- **If I had more time: Add branching dialogue choices and NPC rewards.
